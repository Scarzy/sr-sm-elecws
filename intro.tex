\section{Introduction}
Amoung your supervising blueshirts this week are many who specialise in programming, which you have already experienced.
However, what you have not yet experienced is the more hardware side, done by those of us who are heavily interested in electronics.

All the boards you have been given to use on your robot this week contain electronics to make the boards function as best they can, while also making it as hard as possible for the boards to be damaged.
These boards have all been designed by other blueshirts who are not around this week, however a number of us do work on similar boards.
We wanted a chance to show you what we do and why we enjoy it so much.
