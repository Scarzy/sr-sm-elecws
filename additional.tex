\section{Additional Tasks}
For those of you who finish with plenty of time to spare, here are a couple of suggestions for changes you could make:

\begin{itemize}
\item The filters used in this lab are known as `naive, passive filters'. Active filters can be produced by placing capacitors on a standard op-amp amplifier circuit, which is shown in figure \ref{}.
\item A more accurate clock can be made by using a crystal oscialltor and a phase-lock-loop. The circuit for these is shown in figure \ref{}. The N multiplier is created by the microcontroller, with pin ? as an input, and pin ? as the output.
\end{itemize}
