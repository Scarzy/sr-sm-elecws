\section{Complete System}
So now you have a working knowledge of some electronics, it's time to put them together and see what can be achieved.
Unlike in the previous stages you will not be given a complete circuit for this, instead you will be given a decription of what the circuit should do, and you have to work out how to use the circuits you've already seen to achieve it.

\begin{itemize}
\item The circuit should generate a tune of Humpty Dumpty when the light level gets too low
\item The circuit should generate a tune of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star when the temperature gets too high
\item 
\end{itemize}
