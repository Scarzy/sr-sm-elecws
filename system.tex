\section{Complete System}
So now you have a working knowledge of some electronics, it's time to put them together and see what can be achieved.
Unlike in the previous stages you will not be given a complete circuit for this, instead you will be given a decription of what the circuit should do, and you have to work out how to use the circuits you've already seen to achieve it.

\begin{itemize}
\item The circuit should generate a few bars of Humpty Dumpty when the light level gets too low
\item The circuit should generate a few bars of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star when the temperature gets too high
\item The tune will be generated by a provided microcontroller
\item The microcontroller generates the tune based on a clock input on pin ?
\item It plays Humpty Dumpty when pin ? is high
\item It plays Twinkle Twinkle Little Star when pin ? is high
\item The microcontroller is believed to have a fault, the circuit should compensate for this
\end{itemize}

To help you, here are some useful hints:

\begin{itemize}
\item An integrator and a schmitt trigger connected in a loop produce some interesting repetitive waveforms
\item The circuit will generate a siren sound when both pin ? and ? are high
\item An example schematic is in appendix \ref{}, held by the blueshirts. Please do not use this until you have tried a couple of your own ideas.
\end{itemize}
